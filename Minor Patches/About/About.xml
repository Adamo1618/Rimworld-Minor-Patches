  <description>[WIP] Fixes a few minor issues.
  
  Current additions:
  Increased range for the Charge Rifle.
  Vodka.
  Bleedrate framework, shamelessly stolen from the mod Variable Bleed Rate Framework by ilikegoodfood.
  Donald Trump hair.
  Adam Jensen hair.
  Orbital traders are much more frequent.
  The trait Intimidating.
  The implant Social enhancer, which improves almost all social aspects of the character slightly.
  Some things are renamed for shits and giggles.
  
  Shadowrun related:
  An automatic Gauss Rifle, powerful midrange weapon.
  A trait called Olaf.
  Mist Armor.
  Several augmentations, including:
	Striking Callus, which improves unarmed attacks
	Body Augmentations, increases a range of stats and capacities.
	Mental Augmentations, same as above.
